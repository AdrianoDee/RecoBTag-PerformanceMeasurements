## Software setup

```
cmsrel CMSSW_10_4_0_pre1
cd CMSSW_10_4_0_pre1/src
cmsenv

setenv CMSSW_GIT_REFERENCE /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmssw.git.daily
git cms-init

git cms-addpkg RecoBTag/TensorFlow
git cms-addpkg RecoBTag/Combined
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/master/DeepCSV_PhaseII.json -P RecoBTag/Combined/data/
git cms-merge-topic rauser:DeepJetPhaseII_10_4_X

git clone -b 10_4_0_PhaseII --depth 1 https://github.com/cms-btv-pog/RecoBTag-PerformanceMeasurements.git RecoBTag/PerformanceMeasurements

scram b -j8

```

The ntuplizer can be run and configured through ```RecoBTag/PerformanceMeasurements/test/runBTagAnalyzer_cfg.py```, to run it for 2018 commissioning

```
cmsRun runBTagAnalyzer_cfg.py defaults=Commissioning18 runOnData=(True or False, depending on your needs)
```

To run the tests for integrating changes run:

```
cd RecoBTag/PerformanceMeasurements/test/
./run_tests.sh
```
The content of the output ntuple is by default empty and has to be configured according to your needs. The ```store*Variables``` options have been removed.
The new variable configuration can be customized in the file ```RecoBTag/PerformanceMeasurements/python/varGroups_cfi.py```.
New variables need also to be added (apart from adding them in the code) in ```RecoBTag/PerformanceMeasurements/python/variables_cfi.py```
